clcam is just a simple command line webcam application. It should work
with any standard video4linux2 (uvc) device. Below is a run-down of features/options.

-----------------------------
The current code has issues. I ported to V4L2 and released for my own personal use.
It comes with no warranty or guarantee to work for you or your application.

APPLICATION NOTES
-----------------
Some of the code within this application is derived from examples or other
sources freely available on the internet. The two main sources for clcam
were gqcam, videodog and the capture example from V4L2 source. These are both
licensed under the GNU GPL, and by extention, so is clcam. See the file COPYING
for further information on the GPL and its terms.

If there are some fixes or comments and suggestions you'd like to pass my
way, feel free to do so. I'd like to keep clcam as small and as utilitarian
as possible, but if it's something that catches me, I'll probably fix/add
it.
