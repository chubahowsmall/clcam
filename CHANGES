clcam-0.7.0 [11/22/2011]: Rewrite for Video4Linux2
  - Moved capture engine to V4L2 API
  - Not just generic Quickcam capture anylonger, anything
    supported by uvc/V4L2 can be used.
  - Filters and save types have not changed.
  - There are bugs, and I haven't gotten around to fixing
    them yet. I might.
